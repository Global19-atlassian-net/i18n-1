### CrowdIn Glossary

We have a [CrowdIn Glossary](crowdin-glossary.json) that has some terms which are noted as shared or translatable across the project. If a term is missing, please add it! This glossary will automatically be used by CrowdIn to let translators know about each term when they come across them.


## How translations are selected

Members of the project are either a translator or proofreader. A translator can provide translations, while a proofreader can both provide translations as well as select the best translation to be used on the site.

The final translation that appears in Node.js content is selected as follows:

1. A proofreader selects the best translation.
2. If there is no translation selected by a proofreader, translators vote on the best translation and the translation with the most votes is selected.
3. If votes are tied, the most recent translation will be selected.

## Proofreading

If you would like to be promoted to proofreader status on the Node.js project, please translate 1,000 words or more before applying. When contacting managers on Crowdin, please include a link to your existing translations on the project.

## Introduction to the Crowdin platform

Node.js localization effort uses [Crowdin](<(https://crowdin.com/project/nodejs)>), an awesome platform for collaborative translation.
It's free for open source projects, and anyone who understands multiples languages is welcome to join in the effort, regardless of
their technical experience or familiarity with the Node.js project.

**The Crowdin advantage:**

- Asking translators to jump into the GitHub environment is confusing enough. Crowdin beautifully abstracts away the cruft into a simple & useful interface.

- Each localization project contains a directory tree of the core project’s documents–giving the translator continuous visibility on what has and hasn’t been translated, streamlining the process entirely.

- A simple work environment presents untranslated documents in one row, and the localized version being updated in another.

- A Crowdin project seamlessly integrates with an existing GitHub repo, automating PRs & updates from its internationalization projects.
