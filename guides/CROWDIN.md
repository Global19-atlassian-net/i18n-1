# Crowdin

Node.js localization effort uses [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com), an awesome platform for collaborative translation.
It's free for open source projects, and anyone who understands multiples languages is welcome to join, regardless of
their technical experience or familiarity with the Node.js project. Below you'll find a quick review of main features that we are using in our process from Crowdin side. 

## Glossary

We have a [CrowdIn Glossary](../crowdin-glossary.json) that contains terms which are noted as shared or translatable across the projects. If a term is missing, please add it by creating PR or let us know by a new issue! This glossary will automatically be used by CrowdIn to let translators more context about term.

## GitHub integration

Crowdin pulling updates of original content, and on other side all approved translations going to be pushed to connected repository automatically and well formatted.
